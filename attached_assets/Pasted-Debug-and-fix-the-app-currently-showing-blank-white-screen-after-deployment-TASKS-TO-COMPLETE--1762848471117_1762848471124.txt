Debug and fix the app - currently showing blank white screen after deployment.

TASKS TO COMPLETE:

1. VERIFY FIREBASE CONFIGURATION:
   - Check that PetFitChampions/config/firebase.js exists and is properly configured
   - Verify Firebase imports in all files use correct path: '../config/firebase'
   - Ensure firebase package is installed in package.json
   - Test Firebase initialization doesn't throw errors

2. CHECK ALL PACKAGE DEPENDENCIES:
   - Verify all required packages are in package.json:
     * firebase (^10.7.1)
     * expo (~51.0.0)
     * react-native-paper (^5.0.0)
     * @react-navigation/native (^6.0.0)
     * @react-navigation/stack (^6.0.0)
   - Run npm install to ensure all packages are installed
   - Check for any missing peer dependencies

3. FIX PETCONTEXT INTEGRATION:
   - Verify PetFitChampions/context/PetContext.js imports Firebase correctly
   - Check that PetContext uses Firebase Firestore instead of local storage
   - Ensure auth.onAuthStateChanged is implemented
   - Verify selectPet function creates proper pet document in Firestore

4. CHECK PETSELECTIONSCREEN:
   - Verify PetFitChampions/screens/PetSelectionScreen.js imports PetContext
   - Ensure handleConfirmSelection properly calls selectPet from context
   - Check navigation works after pet selection
   - Verify all starter pets (VIGOR, ZEN, ATLAS, SWIFT, AERO) are rendered
   - Ensure ScrollView has contentContainerStyle for proper scrolling

5. VERIFY APP.JS STRUCTURE:
   - Check that PetProvider wraps the entire app
   - Verify navigation is properly configured
   - Ensure no circular imports

6. TEST AUTHENTICATION FLOW:
   - Verify signup/login screens work with Firebase Auth
   - Check that new users are redirected to PetSelectionScreen
   - Ensure existing users skip pet selection

7. CHECK CONSOLE FOR ERRORS:
   - Look for any JavaScript errors in browser console
   - Check for Firebase initialization errors
   - Verify no import/module not found errors

8. FIX COMMON ISSUES:
   - Ensure no undefined variables
   - Check all async/await functions have try-catch blocks
   - Verify all Firebase calls use correct syntax
   - Make sure no components are missing required props

9. TEST THE FIX:
   - Clear cache and rebuild: rm -rf .expo node_modules && npm install
   - Start dev server: npx expo start --web --clear
   - Verify app loads without blank screen
   - Test pet selection flow end-to-end

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
- App loads successfully (no blank screen)
- Pet selection screen shows all 5 starter pets
- Selecting a pet saves to Firebase and navigates to home
- No errors in browser console
- All packages properly installed
