I want to build a gamified health tracking mobile app called "PetFit Champions" using React Native/Expo. This is a comprehensive wellness app where users track health activities to earn XP and level up virtual pets that can battle in PvP/PvE modes.

=== CORE FEATURES ===

1. USER & AUTHENTICATION
- Email/password signup and login
- User profile with username, avatar, current pet display
- Persistent session management

2. HEALTH TRACKING SYSTEM
Track these activities (each generates XP):
- Steps (manual input or API integration placeholder)
- Sleep hours (manual input)
- Mood check-ins (emoji selector: 😊😐😢😠😴)
- Meditation minutes (timer functionality)
- Journal entries (text input)
- Water intake (counter/tracker)
- Meals logged (quick rating: healthy/ok/unhealthy)
- Breathing exercises (guided timer)

XP Conversion rates:
- 10k steps = 200 XP
- 8hrs sleep = 150 XP  
- 3 healthy meals = 150 XP
- 10min meditation = 100 XP
- Journal entry = 100 XP
- 3 mood check-ins = 150 XP
- Breathing exercise = 50 XP
- Complete ALL daily tasks = +200 bonus XP

3. PET SYSTEM
Starter pets (user chooses one):
- Vigor (Dog): High Stamina
- Zen (Cat): High Agility
- Atlas (Bear): High Strength/Defense
- Swift (Bird): High Energy

Pet stats (scale 1-100):
- Health, Energy, Strength, Defense, Stamina, Agility, Attack

Leveling system:
- Level 1-10: 1000 XP per level
- Level 11-25: 1500 XP per level
- Level 26-50: 2500 XP per level
- On level-up: Award gems equal to level number (e.g., Level 5 = 5 gems)

Evolution tiers:
- Tier 1: Level 1-15 (Basic)
- Tier 2: Level 16-35 (costs 150 gems to evolve)
- Tier 3: Level 36-60 (costs 500 gems to evolve)

4. GEM ECONOMY
Ways to earn gems:
- Level-up rewards (gems = current level)
- Daily login streak (+1 gem per day, max 30)
- Battle victories (5-20 gems)
- Weekly challenges (50 gems)

Gem spending:
- Pet cosmetics (50-200 gems)
- Stat boosts (+5 permanent, 300 gems)
- New pet slot (500 gems, max 3 pets)
- Evolution unlocks (150 or 500 gems)

5. BATTLE SYSTEM (PVP)
- Turn-based 1v1 combat
- 3 move types: Attack, Defend, Special
- Battle uses pet stats to calculate damage/defense
- Winner steals 10-30% of opponent's unspent gems
- Energy system: 20 energy per battle (regenerates 1 per 10 min, cap at 100)
- Matchmaking by level range (±5 levels)

6. UI/UX REQUIREMENTS
- Clean, modern design with card-based layouts
- Bottom navigation: Home, Track, Pet, Battle, Profile
- Home screen: Daily progress dashboard, pet display, quick actions
- Track screen: All health tracking inputs organized by category
- Pet screen: Stats display, evolution options, customization
- Battle screen: Matchmaking, battle interface, history
- Smooth animations for level-ups, battles, stat changes

7. DATA PERSISTENCE
Use AsyncStorage or local SQLite database for:
- User profile data
- Pet data (stats, level, cosmetics)
- Health activity logs (last 30 days)
- Gem balance
- Battle history

=== TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS ===

Stack:
- React Native with Expo
- State management: React Context API or Redux
- Navigation: React Navigation
- UI components: React Native Paper or NativeBase
- Icons: React Native Vector Icons
- Animations: React Native Reanimated (optional)

Project structure:
/src
/screens (Home, Track, Pet, Battle, Profile, Auth)
/components (reusable UI components)
/context (state management)
/utils (XP calculations, battle logic)
/data (pet templates, constants)
/assets (images, icons)


=== DEVELOPMENT PHASES ===

PHASE 1 - MVP (Start here):
1. Authentication screens (login/signup)
2. Basic home screen with user info
3. Health tracking screen with manual inputs for:
   - Steps, sleep, mood, water, meditation timer
4. XP calculation and display
5. Single starter pet (Vigor) with basic stats
6. Level-up system with gem rewards
7. Pet stats screen

PHASE 2:
1. Add all 4 starter pets with pet selection screen
2. Gem economy and gem balance display
3. Basic pet customization (stat boosts)
4. Daily streak tracker
5. Evolution system (3 tiers)

PHASE 3:
1. PvP battle system (turn-based combat)
2. Battle matchmaking (mock/random for now)
3. Energy system and regeneration
4. Battle history and win/loss tracking
5. Gem stealing mechanics

PHASE 4:
1. Multiple pet slots
2. Pet collection screen
3. Enhanced cosmetics system
4. Weekly challenges
5. Leaderboards

=== IMMEDIATE FIRST STEPS ===

Please create:
1. Project setup with Expo React Native
2. Basic file structure as outlined above
3. Authentication flow (signup/login screens)
4. Simple home screen that shows:
   - Welcome message with username
   - Current XP progress bar
   - Today's tracked activities count
   - "Track Activity" button
5. Navigation between screens

Use placeholder data initially. Focus on clean code structure and component reusability. Add comments explaining key logic.

Start with PHASE 1, Step 1. Let's build this iteratively.
